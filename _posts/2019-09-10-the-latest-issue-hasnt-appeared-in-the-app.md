The app needs to be open and connected to the internet to receive the latest data and new issues, If you think there should be a new issue that you can't see, you can try refreshing the app by pulling down anywhere on the screen.

If you are sure that the app isn't showing the latest issue, there may be a problem caused by some corrupted data. You should try deleting and reinstalling the app.
